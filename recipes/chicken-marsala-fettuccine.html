  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    Chicken marsala over fettucine is a wonderfully rich Italian-American dish. Think chicken cutlets, mushrooms, and
    spinach cooked in a creamy Marsala wine sauce served over pastaâ€”the ultimate comfort food.
  </p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 (16 ounce) package uncooked fettuccine</li>
    <li>1/4 cup, plus 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour, divided</li>
    <li>1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, divided</li>
    <li>1 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breast tenderloins, patted dry</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
    <li>1 large shallot, finely chopped</li>
    <li>1 (8 ounce) package fresh sliced cremini mushrooms</li>
    <li>1 1/2 cups Marsala wine</li>
    <li>1 cup chicken stock</li>
    <li>1 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons Italian seasoning</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
    <li>1 (10 ounce) package fresh baby spinach</li>
    <li>4 ounces Parmesan cheese, finely shredded</li>
    <li>finely chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
    <li>
      Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high. Add fettuccine; cook 2 minutes less than package
      instructions for al dente. Drain, reserving 1/2 cup cooking water.
    </li>
    <li>
      While pasta cooks, stir together 1/4 cup of the flour and 1/4 teaspoon of the salt in a large bowl. Add chicken
      tenders, one at a time, and toss to coat evenly with flour. Shake excess flour off chicken, and transfer to a
      plate.
    </li>
    <li>
      Heat a large skillet over medium-high, add oil and butter; cook, swirling often, until butter melts, 30 to 45
      seconds. Place chicken tenders in skillet in a single layer, and cook, turning once halfway through, until browned
      and a thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the tender registers 165 degrees F (73 degrees C), about 8
      minutes. Transfer chicken to a wire rack.
    </li>
    <li>
      Add shallot to skillet; cook over medium-high, stirring constantly, until translucent, about 1 minute. Add
      mushrooms; cook, stirring often, until browned on edges, about 3 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>Stir in Marsala; cook, stirring occasionally and scraping browned bits off bottom of skillet, until slightly
      reduced, about 4 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>Stir in chicken stock, cream, Italian seasoning, black pepper, and garlic powder; bring to a boil over
      medium-high. Reduce heat to medium, and cook, stirring occasionally, until sauce is slightly thickened, about 3
      minutes.
    </li>
    <li>Whisk in remaining 2 tablespoons flour and 1 1/4 teaspoons salt until smooth, about 1 minute. Stir in spinach;
      cook, stirring often, until spinach is wilted, about 1 minute.
    </li>
    <li>Add pasta and chicken tenders; cook over medium-high, tossing constantly, until heated through, about 2 minutes.
      Remove from heat. Stir in Parmesan until combined, adding reserved pasta water 2 tablespoons at a time, if needed,
      to reach desired consistency. Garnish with chopped fresh parsley and serve immediately.
    </li>
  </ol>
